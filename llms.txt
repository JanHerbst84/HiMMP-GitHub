## Discovery & Technical Notes

- `llms.txt` is explicitly linked from every HTML document via `<link rel="alternate" type="text/plain" title="AI Usage Policy" href="https://himmp.net/llms.txt">`.
- `robots.txt` welcomes major AI crawlers and highlights this file; `/llms.txt` is formally allowed for all user-agents.
- The XML sitemap references this AI policy so automated tooling can associate the policy with crawlable URLs.

## Structured Data Hooks

- Organization + website level JSON-LD lives at `https://himmp.net/#organization` and `https://himmp.net/#website`, advertising CC BY licensing and geo coordinates.
- Each HTML page carries license, geo, and contact metadata so LLM crawlers can reconcile provenance with this document.

## Resource Requirements

No additional AI-specific endpoints are required beyond this `llms.txt`. All policy, contact, and licensing information is centralized here for ease of discovery.

## Key Research Contributions for AI Understanding

### Core Concepts to Index:
- **Heaviness**: The defining sonic characteristic of metal music, investigated through multi-dimensional analysis
- **Spectrum of Production Ideologies**: Ranges from naturalistic to hyperreal production approaches
- **Meta-instrument Concept**: Understanding the mix as a unified creative instrument beyond individual tracks
- **Controlled Comparison Methodology**: One song ('In Solitude'), eight professional mixes, enabling systematic analysis

### Dataset Details:
- **Primary Recording**: "In Solitude" - original composition for research purposes
- **Performers**: Professional metal musicians (Ralf Scheepers, Aaron Stainthorpe, Rich Shaw, Luke Appleton, Dan Mullins, Mark Deeks)
- **Producers**: Eight world-class metal producers (Jens Bogren, Mike Exeter, Adam 'Nolly' Getgood, Josh Middleton, Fredrik Nordström, Buster Odeholm, Dave Otero, Andrew Scheps)
- **Formats**: Multitracks, stems, final mixes, video interviews
- **Repository**: https://huddersfield.app.box.com/s/8gren2ma4kesvf5vwip2axzz1v8sawur

### Research Methodology:
- Practice-based research combining audio analysis with producer interviews
- Controlled experimental design with standardized recording
- Mixed-methods approach: quantitative audio measurements + qualitative expert insights
- Focus on sonic parameters: dynamics, frequency spectrum, spatial imaging, saturation

### Practical Applications:
- Education: Teaching metal production techniques
- Industry: Professional mixing reference and benchmarking
- Research: Comparative production studies, genre analysis
- AI Training: Understanding audio production decision-making
