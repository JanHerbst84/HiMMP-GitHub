                        <h3>About HiMMP</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ever since Black Sabbath released their self-titled debut album in
                            1970, metal music has been on a quest for greater heaviness. This
                            pursuit has led to increasingly extreme performances and
                            specialised recording techniques. But it is not just about pushing the
                            limits of human performance; advancements in music production, such as layering guitar
                            sounds, enhancing drums, and digital editing, have played a
                            crucial role in creating hyperreal performances and powerful,
                            'heavy' sounds. Our aim is to gain a better understanding of what
                            defines 'heaviness', exploring how it is captured and conveyed in the
                            production process.

                        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                        <p>
                            Heaviness in metal music results from a complex interplay of genre,
                            composition, performance, and mixing techniques. We explore this
                            intricate relationship to understand how these elements shape the
                            producer's personal style, aesthetic vision, and adherence to
                            genre conventions. By collaborating with eight producers
                            on a single song, 'In Solitude', we study the diverse approaches to
                            mixing the track and creating heaviness.

                        <p>
                            Our research team comprises two experts in popular music and
                            music technology, both with extensive experience in
                            performing, producing, and studying music and audio
                            engineering. They are joined by an international advisory board of
                            music and music production specialists from Australia to
                            Germany. More importantly, the project relies on the collaboration
                            of eight world-renowned metal music producers, whose
                            involvement is key to broadening our understanding of 'heaviness'.
