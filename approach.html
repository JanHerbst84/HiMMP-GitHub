                <p class="page-intro">
                    <strong>Research & impact statement //</strong> HiMMP is all about the song 'In Solitude',
                    composed, recorded, mixed, and mastered by our research team. Not only
                    have we documented every step along the way of creating the song and
                    made the media files publicly available, but we also took the recording
                    (multitrack) to world-leading metal music producers to mix and produce their
                    own versions of the song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Video interviews with producers about heaviness and their mixing of 'In
                    Solitude' not only provide a wealth of data for researching heaviness but are
                    also an invaluable educational resource for interested metal music producers
                    and artists. Our comprehensive documentation and systematic analysis offer
                    deep insights into the core quality of metal, with the potential to revolutionise
                    how practitioners understand and achieve heaviness.

                    <p>
                        Our research centres around the song 'In Solitude', which was arranged and recorded by
                        the HiMMP team with the help of well-known artists in the metal scene: Ralf Scheepers
                        (vocals; Primal Fear, Avantasia, Gamma Ray); Aaron Stainsthorpe (vocals; My Dying Bride);
                        Rich Shaw (guitar; ex Cradle of Filth); Luke Appleton (bass; ex-Iced Earth, Blaze Bayley);
                        Dan Mullins (drums; My Dying Bride); Mark Deeks (orchestration; Winterfylleth). The
                        HiMMP researchers created their own production of the song as a version that can be
                        compared with those of world-leading metal producers participating in the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The multitrack provides various options (e.g., drum samples, clean and unedited tom
                        tracks, various bass guitar layers, different guitar tones) to allow producers to customise
                        their mix. The professional producers mix the song in their regular working environment,
                        followed by a video interview about heaviness and their approach to producing 'In Solitude'.
                        Each producer's original mix, along with video documentation and interviews, forms a rich
                        dataset for exploring the phenomenon of musical heaviness. This comprehensive material
                        allows us to study how heaviness can be controlled and achieved in metal music
                        production, examining the interplay between creative freedom, engineering and acoustic
                        constraints, genre expectations, and trade-offs between attributes such as sonic weight vs
                        clarity and separation vs cohesion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our outcome is an empirically grounded framework of heaviness derived from industry
                        practice. This framework is not only theoretically but also audio-visually comprehensible
                        through our extensive audio and video documentation. Aspiring producers can apply this
                        framework to their own tracks, or mix and learn from the publicly available multitrack of 'In
                        Solitude'.
