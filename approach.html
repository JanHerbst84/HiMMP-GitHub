                        Our research centred around the song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3qk8nfMpCTLHtGSew8oD7O?si=4c3dc468476a4426" target="_blank"><u><b>'In Solitude'</b></u></a>, which was arranged and recorded by
                        the HiMMP team with the help of well-known artists in the metal scene: <b>Ralf Scheepers</b>
                        (vocals; Primal Fear, Avantasia, Gamma Ray); <b>Aaron Stainsthorpe</b> (vocals; My Dying Bride);
                        <b>Rich Shaw</b> (guitar; ex Cradle of Filth); <b>Luke Appleton</b> (bass; ex-Iced Earth, Blaze Bayley);
                        <b>Dan Mullins</b> (drums; My Dying Bride); <b>Mark Deeks</b> (orchestration; Winterfylleth). The
                        HiMMP researchers created their own production of the song as a version that can be
                        compared with those of world-leading metal producers participating in the project.

                        The <a href="https://huddersfield.box.com/s/8gren2ma4kesvf5vwip2axzz1v8sawur" target="_blank"><u><b>multitrack</b></u></a> provided various options (e.g., drum samples, clean and unedited tom
                        tracks, various bass guitar layers, different guitar tones) to allow <a href="team.html">producers</a> to customise
                        their mix. The professional <a href="team.html">producers</a> mix the song in their regular working environment,
                        followed by a video interview about heaviness and their approach to producing 'In Solitude'.
                        Each <a href="team.html">producer's</a> original mix, along with video documentation and interviews, forms a rich
                        dataset for exploring the phenomenon of musical heaviness. This comprehensive material
                        allows us to study how heaviness can be controlled and achieved in metal music
                        production, examining the interplay between creative freedom, engineering and acoustic
                        constraints, genre expectations, and trade-offs between attributes such as sonic weight vs
                        clarity and separation vs cohesion.

                    <p>
                        Our outcome was an empirically grounded framework of heaviness derived from industry
                        practice. This framework is not only theoretically but also audio-visually comprehensible
                        through our extensive audio and video documentation. Aspiring producers can apply this
                        framework to their own tracks, or mix and learn from the publicly available multitrack of 'In
                        Solitude'.
