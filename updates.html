                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Heaviness in Metal Music Production: How and Why It Works</strong> – A scholarly analysis of the concept of heaviness, exploring its theoretical foundations, historical development, and contemporary applications in metal music production.</li>
                                <li><strong>Heaviness in Metal Music Production: Learn from the Masters</strong> – A practical guide for producers and engineers, featuring insights and techniques from the eight world-class producers who participated in our research.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Both books are scheduled for publication in early 2026 and will include access to audio examples and additional digital resources. These publications represent a significant milestone in our efforts to document and disseminate the knowledge gained through the HiMMP project.

                                The HiMMP research team has completed the comprehensive analysis of all producer interviews and mix comparisons. This milestone marks the conclusion of the data collection and primary analysis phase of the project, enabling us to move forward with the preparation of our final outputs.
