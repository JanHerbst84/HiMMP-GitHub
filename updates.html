                            <p>
                                The research team has returned from a productive session in Stockholm, where we conducted interviews and mixing sessions with Jens Bogren and Fredrik Nordström. Both producers offered valuable insights into the Swedish approach to metal production, which has been influential in defining the sound of several metal subgenres. The contrasting approaches of these two renowned producers provide a fascinating study in how different technical and aesthetic priorities can achieve comparable perceptions of heaviness through distinct sonic signatures.

                                The project has scheduled field trips to Stockholm, Sweden, and Cardiff, Wales, in December to work with multiple producers. The Stockholm session will involve collaborations with seminal Swedish metal producers Jens Bogren and Fredrik Nordström, while the Cardiff session will focus on the mixing approach of Mike Exeter, known for his work with Black Sabbath and Judas Priest. These sessions will provide valuable comparative data on regional variations in metal production aesthetics and technical approaches to creating heaviness.

                                We have submitted our chapter "Contemporary Approaches to Metal Music Mixing and Production: Heavy Metal, Death Metal, and Metalcore" for the forthcoming Routledge Companion to Metal Music Composition. This chapter examines subgenre-specific production techniques identified through the HiMMP project and contextualises them within broader compositional frameworks. The publication will provide an important resource for understanding the relationship between composition and production in contemporary metal music.

                                The fifth and sixth producer interviews and mixing sessions have been completed successfully. These sessions documented contrasting approaches to achieving heaviness in metal production, with particular focus on dynamic processing strategies and spectral balance considerations. The recorded material provides valuable comparative data for our analysis of production techniques across different metal subgenres and production philosophies.

                                Renowned producer and engineer Mike Exeter has joined the HiMMP project. Known for his work with Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and Tony Iommi, Exeter brings extensive experience in traditional heavy metal production. His participation will provide valuable historical context and insight into the evolution of heaviness in recorded metal music, particularly in relation to the foundational British heavy metal sound that influenced subsequent developments in the genre.
