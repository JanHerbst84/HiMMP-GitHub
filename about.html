                        Despite the rich history and cultural impact of metal music, there is
                        surprisingly little understanding of what exactly makes it sound so 'heavy'.
                        Our research addresses this gap by <span class="highlight-text">examining how 'heaviness' is created and
                        captured in the recording and mixing process.</span> This research will have a
                        significant global impact on our understanding of this defining characteristic
                        of metal music.

                    <p>
                        At present, there is a lack of music production knowledge and
                        educational material that would enable those interested in understanding
                        how top producers capture, manipulate, and present the various qualities
                        that constitute heaviness.

                    <p>
                        To learn how internationally known producers create heaviness in
                        different metal subgenres, we are documenting their mixing for a single
                        song, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3qk8nfMpCTLHtGSew8oD7O?si=4c3dc468476a4426" target="_blank"><u><b>'In Solitude'</b></u></a>, which incorporates elements from doom metal,
                        symphonic metal, thrash metal, and modern extreme metal. By
                        alternating between these subgenres, we are encouraging the producers
                        to respond to the changing styles in a way that is easy to observe. Each
                        step in the producers' process is documented through screen-captures,
                        in-depth video interviews explaining their decision-making, and the final
                        audio mix along with individual instrument and vocal stems.

                        All song materials – the multitrack, drum samples taken from the kit, DI
                        tracks for guitar and bass, the mix project files, the edited videos of the
                        producers' sessions and interviews, and all audio bounces and stems –
                        are available on this website (<a href="downloads-resources.html"><u><b>access the data here</b></u></a>). These resources
                        provide a window into the sophisticated decision-making processes and
                        techniques employed by top metal producers.

                        academic journals, and ultimately, all findings are compiled into a book

                        <p>
                            Heaviness in recorded metal music has largely gone unexplored in academic
                            research. This project explores the intricate interplay between musical
                            structure, performance, and production to uncover the secrets behind producing
                            heaviness in recorded metal music.

                        <p>
                            Metal music producers play a key role in shaping the sound of the genre and setting
                            industry standards. By capturing their individual perspectives on heaviness and
                            their production approaches, we are adding a valuable practitioner's voice to
                            the emerging scholarly discussion around metal music.

                        <h4>3 // To determine variations in the production approaches to heaviness in different subgenres of metal.</h4>
                        <p>
                            Heaviness in metal music is a complex blend of factors, including structural
                            features, performance attributes, recording techniques, and mixing
                            approaches, all of which vary across metal subgenres for both aesthetic and technical
                            reasons. These stylistic differences demand distinct approaches to producing
                            heaviness. By documenting the mixing processes of different producers, we gain
                            valuable insights into their individual approaches and identify both
                            commonalities and differences.

                        <p>
                            The production of metal music is a delicate balancing act between artistic expression
                            and technical/acoustic limitations. The genre's rich instrumentation, spectral
                            density, and fast tempos require meticulous sonic control. By collaborating
                            with producers who specialise in different subgenres of metal, we are able to analyse
                            the intricate interplay between creative choices and technical constraints in
                            shaping heaviness in recorded music. Such knowledge can only be gained from
                            experienced practitioners.

                        <p>
                            The research offers a behind-the-scenes look at how leading producers approach
                            mixing metal tracks. These insights provide a helpful resource for aspiring music
                            producers and practice-led researchers, while also shedding light on the empirical
                            basis of heaviness in metal music. By analysing the producers' mixes, we gain
                            audible demonstrations of their individual approaches and showcase the range of
                            possibilities – or lack thereof – for achieving heaviness. This comprehensive
                            understanding of the entire metal production process is essential for building
                            a robust theory of 'heaviness'.
