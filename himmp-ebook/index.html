                    <p class="hero-text"><strong><em>Primarily written for metal producers, mix engineers, and advanced home recordists working in heavy music.</em></strong><br/>This is where our research becomes your practical toolkit. Drawing on the 'Heaviness in Metal Music Production' (HiMMP) project, it distils our findings into an applied guide for contemporary metal production. You can read it on its own or alongside the project’s full dataset, videos, and publications at <a href="https://www.himmp.net">www.himmp.net</a>. Go hands-on with the core philosophies and technical analyses from our study; audio examples are provided throughout.</p>

                <h2>What Really Creates Heaviness?</h2>
        
                <p>Our research suggests that 'heaviness' is not one single sound; it is the result of a producer's core philosophy. We found these approaches exist on a spectrum: from the 'Naturalistic' approach (focused on capturing organic performance) to the 'Hyperreal' approach (engineering a 'larger-than-life' sound). This guide breaks down our findings chapter by chapter, with practical examples and audio from the project.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Newer to production?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are relatively new to recording or mixing heavy music, you may find it helpful 
                    to skim the <a href="chapters/glossary.html"><strong>Glossary</strong></a> first, especially 
                    the entries on <em>transient</em>, <em>phase alignment</em>, <em>meta-instrument</em>, 
                    <em>bleed</em>, and <em>bus compression</em>. Having these concepts in mind will make 
                    the rest of the guide easier to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More experienced producers and mix engineers can jump straight into the chapters 
                    and refer back to the Glossary as needed.
                </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Video Walkthroughs and Mix Comparisons</h3>
                <p>Alongside this written guide, the <strong>Heaviness in Metal Music Production (HiMMP)</strong> project provides extensive video material on the <em>HiMMP-Research</em> YouTube channel. These videos complement the chapters here and allow you to see and hear many of the concepts in practice.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conceptual interviews</strong>: in-depth conversations with each of the eight producers about their philosophies of heaviness, workflows, and production decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mix documentation sessions</strong>: screen-captured walkthroughs of the actual 'In Solitude' mixes, showing how drums, guitars, bass, vocals, and effects were shaped in the DAW.</li>
                    <li><strong>Researchers' mix comparison video</strong>: a systematic comparison of all eight mixes, highlighting contrasting production approaches to the same source material.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you prefer to learn by watching and listening, or you want to connect specific techniques in this guide to real session workflows, use these videos as a parallel resource. You can find them on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HiMMP-Research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HiMMP-Research YouTube channel</strong></a> or by following the video links provided on <a href="https://himmp.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>himmp.net</strong></a>.</p>
