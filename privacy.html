                        HiMMP. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the
                        management of the Website himmp.net. The use of the Internet
                        pages of the Website himmp.net is possible without any indication of
                        personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special
                        enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data
                        could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is
                        necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
                        generally obtain consent from the data subject.</b>

                    <p>
                        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
                        address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
                        with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance
                        with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the
                        Website himmp.net. By means of this data protection declaration, we
                        would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
                        of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
                        subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of
                        the rights to which they are entitled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The controller has implemented numerous technical and organizational
                        measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data
                        processed through this website. However, Internet-based data
                        transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute
                        protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is
                        free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by
                        telephone.

                    <p>
                        The data protection declaration of the Website himmp.net is based on
                        the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the
                        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
                        declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public,
                        as well as our partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the

                            identifiable natural person ("data subject"). An identifiable natural
                            person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
                            particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
                            identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or

                            Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a
                            manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a
                            specific data subject without the use of additional information,
                            provided that such additional information is kept separately and is
                            subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the

                        of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this
                        personal data to third parties.

                            Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
                            legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular
                            situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning
                            him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the
                            GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
                            
                            <p>The Website himmp.net shall no longer process the personal data
                            in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate
                            compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override
                            the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the
                            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>

                            for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is
                            related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the
                            Website himmp.net to the processing for direct marketing
                            purposes, the Website himmp.net will no longer process the

                            or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data
                            concerning him or her by the Website himmp.net for scientific or
                            historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to
                            Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for
                            the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>

                    <h3>7. Legal basis for the processing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations
                        for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the
                        processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a
                        contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example,
                        when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to
                        provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b
                        GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are
                        necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the
                        case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If we are subject
                        to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required,
                        such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on
                        Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to
                        protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
                        person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in
                        our premises and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital
                        information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other
                        third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR.
                        This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered
                        by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary
                        for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
                        party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
                        fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
                        protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly
                        permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the
                        European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be
                        assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47
                        Sentence 2 GDPR).

                    <h3>8. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h3>
                    <p>
                        Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR
                        our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-
                        being of all.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-divider"></div>

                    <h3>9. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h3>
                    <p>
                        The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is
                        the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period,
                        the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer
                        necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
                    </p>

                    <div class="section-divider"></div>

                    <h3>10. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data</h3>
                    <p>
                        We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law
                        (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.
                        information on the contractual partner).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data
                        subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be
                        processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us
                        with personal data when we sign a contract with him or her. The non-
                        provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the
                        contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject
                        must contact the controller. He then clarifies to the data subject whether
                        the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is
                        necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an
                        obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-
                        provision of the personal data.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or
                        profiling.
